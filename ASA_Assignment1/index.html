        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <strong>Name: </strong>Dorothy Ibia<br>
        <strong>Alt School ID: </strong>ALT/SOE/024/5047<br>
        <strong>Learning Track: </strong>School of Engineering
        <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am a medical device design verification Engineer with a background in Mechanical and Biomedical
            Engineering. I like to
            describe myself as the bridge between science and arts, because I am just as much an artist as I am a
            scientist. My interests vary from time to time, but currently, I'm hung up on Software as Medical Devices
            (SAMDs), theology and medical
            TV dramas. I love to sing, in fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I also love to read and write poetry. If
            you had followed me on Twitter between 2016 and 2020, you'd have seen some of my poetry. I know at this
            point you may be wondering,
            "who exactly is Dorothy? Is she a biomechanical engineer, a design verification engineer, or a poet? Well,
            there's just one answer to that question - she is everything. Dorothy is the one that does it all.

        <h2>Why Alt School?</h2>
        <p>
            While working as a medical device design verification engineer, I have built proficiency in hardware testing. However, seeing as
            most modern medical devices are controlled by software, I realised that there was a gap in my knowledge. In
            order to effectively develop and verify medical devices, I have to understand and be able to develop the
            software that controls them.
            Now I am not new to the world of online courses. However, after trying and failing several times at going the self-taught route, I realised that I needed to give structure to my learning process. This lead to

        <h2>My Goals for the Next Year with AltSchool</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the fundamentals of software development</li>
            <li>Learn how to solve problems with the computing skills I hope to build during the course of this program
            </li>
            <li>Lay the building blocks for eventually developing Software as Medical Devices (SAMDs)</li>
            <li>Build competency in object oriented programming (Python)</li>
            <li>Collaborate with other engineers on projects and solutions</li>
        </ul>
